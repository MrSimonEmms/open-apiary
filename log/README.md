# Log

This is the place where application logs are stored. This is the default behaviour
for running the application - in Docker, the logs are sent to STDOut.

The logs are formatted using [Pino](https://getpino.io). To view the logs in a 
human-readable format, please pipe the logs through 
[Pino Pretty](https://getpino.io/#/docs/pretty).
