# Setup

::: warning DANGER
It is recommended that you go through this process immediately, especially
if it is accessible from the internet.

The setup process is completely open and anyone with the URL will be able to
create the initial user.

The setup process is very simple and is required to get the initial user 
created.

If you log onto [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you will be redirected
to the setup page. This is only accessible if there are zero users configured in
the database.

To complete the setup page, you will need to create an initial user. All users
have the same permissions and access. With regards to the passwords, it is 
recommended that you use a password manager to generate secure passwords, although
this is not a required.

One your initial user is created, you will be redirected to the login page. Login
with the user that you just created. You can now go to the [Usage](../usage)
section.
