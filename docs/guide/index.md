# Introduction

Open Apiary is a web application that helps you managed your apiaries and bee hives.
It's built with ease and simplicity in mind, allowing you to access your hive 
records from anywhere with an internet connection.

## How it works

An Open Apiary installation consists of a NodeJS application that connects to a
database. Once you've got it running, it will automatically provision your 
database allowing you to add users and track your hive records. 

## Features

- Easy, graphical setup
- Unlimited apiaries
- Unlimited hives
- Unlimited inspection reports
- Unlimited users
- Hive barcode scanner
- Self-hosted, including on a Raspberry Pi
- Choice of databases - currently MySQL and SQLite

## Roadmap

Like all software, this is a work-in-progress. Future developments will include:

- Automated hive health checks - see how your hive is without visiting or opening it
- Emergency help
- Support additional databases (eg, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL, MongoDB)
